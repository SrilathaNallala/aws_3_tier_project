# aws_3_tier_project
The aim of this project is to design and deploy a 3-tier web application architecture on AWS with a strong focus on scalability, high availability, and security. The architecture is divided into three layers—frontend, backend, and database—to ensure modularity and resilience. The application layer is deployed on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling to dynamically handle traffic fluctuations, while the data layer uses Amazon RDS (MySQL) with Multi-AZ for durability and reliability. This project demonstrates how cloud-native services can be integrated to build a secure, fault-tolerant, and production-ready application.
